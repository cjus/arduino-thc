Arduino BLE Time Hacker Clock

A Time Hacker Clock is a device based on the Time Hacker Method (THM). THM combines simple productivity guidelines with devices that emit shapes or colors to quickly convey how much time remains in a given day or time block.

This version of the clock uses an Ardunio based microcontroller to light a plastic dome.  The clock shown is powered by a small battery and controlled using a mobile app via Bluetooth.

The colors used are from the [HSV color space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV), essentially the colors from green to red in a 120-degree range.
