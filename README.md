Arduino BLE Time Hacker Clock

A Time Hacker Clock is a device based on the Time Hacker Method (THM). THM combines simple productivity guidelines with devices that emit shapes or colors to quickly convey how much time remains in a given day or time block.

## Features

* Bluetooth BLE, constrollable via mobile phone
* Realtime clock
* Support for various NeoPixel lighting modules

## Software
Make sure you have a recent version of the [Ardunio IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) installed.
In the IDE under `Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries` search for and add the following libraries:

* Adafruit BluefruitLE nRF51
* Adafruit NeoPixel
* RTCLib by Adafruit

### Third party Bluetooth mobile apps

The Ardunio THC can be controlled using anyone of several third party mobile app.

#### Android phone controller app

* LightBlue Explorer: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lightblue/id557428110

#### Supported commands

THC commands consist of three letter names optionally preceeded by one or more parameters.

Commands are submitted via one of the above mobile applications via the UART terminal.

**Get date**

Get the date set on the THC device.

```shell
gtd
```

**Get time**

Get the current time on the THC realtime clock. You must do this when powering up your THC for the first time and when it becomes time to replace the THC battery. A xxxx battery should last about a year.

```shell
gtm
```

**Set clock**

Set the current date and time.

```shell
sck 20181001 080206
```

Date time is in `yyyymmdd hhmmss` format.
Each field must be 2 digit and preceeded with a zero if necessary. The year is always a 4 digit field.

Time must be in a 24 hour clock format.

**Set time block range**

Set the duration of a time block by specifying a start hour and end hour.
Each field must be 2 digit and perceeded with a zero if necessary.
Time must be in a 24 hour clock format.

```shell
srg 05 20
```

The above example sets a time block range from 5am to 8pm.

**Get version**

Get the THC software version.

```shell
ver
```
